   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to NeurAL's documentation!
==================================

This library is designed to provide easy *shortcut* methods for processing neuroimaging data
with Python. The functions are simply meant as wrappers for different command line programs
and simple functions to replace common scripts.

For a more comprehensive analysis library, see the NIPy project: http://nipy.org


General Structure
====================

The library is organized into functional modules either by task category (e.g., :mod:`neural.dicom`) or software package (e.g., :mod:`neural.afni`). Functions that are
generally useful also are copied to the root level (e.g., :meth:`neural.prefix`)

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   afni
   dicom
